V1 -> V2:
* merged 2 patches in 1, fixing both issues: WARN_ON_ONCE with
  syzkaller repro and missing XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM in pad
* changed the title and description of the execution path, suggested
  by Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>
* move the limit check from tun_can_build_skb() to tun_build_skb() to
  remove duplication and locking issue, and also drop the packet in
  case of a failed check - noted by Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>
